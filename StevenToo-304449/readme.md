# Introduction
Yelp is an American multinational corporation founded in 2004 which aimed at helping people locate local business based on social networking functionally and reviews. Yelp also has a star rating system that lets users easily see what the general opinion about a particular establishment is without having to read all the reviews for that particular business.
Millions of people use Yelp restaurant reviews in their food choice decision-making. Empirical data research demonstrated that a one-star increase led to 59% increase in revenue of independent restaurants (Lucas, 2011). Therefore, we see great potential of Yelp dataset as a valuable insights repository either for customers in their food hunting quest or for businesses to optimize their operations and align themselves with their market.
